Job Information and notification
5-6 years ago, if someone has to land a job in Google, the pre-requisite was to first get into an IIT.
Not because of the quality of education, but also because of no possibility of getting an interview call otherwise.

Off-campus job means a job secured by giving interviews directly in organisation without any involvement from your College’s training and placement cell.
Off-campus placements are a blessing for Tier-3 or Tier-2 college students.
It is the only hope for these excellent students to work for good companies with decent to high paying salaries.

The placement session for any company generally has 3 – 4 rounds.
The first round is the written test, consisting of quantitative aptitude,
reasoning (logical ability), English (verbal ability) and computer science subjects (C, C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, DBMS, OS, Networks, etc.).
For some companies, you might also have a coding round, which is sometimes taken as a separate round and sometimes is clubbed with the written test.
Further rounds are interview rounds, the first two usually being the technical round and successive rounds being the HR round.
